                "explanation": "A common approach is to iterate through the array while inserting elements into a HashSet. If an element already exists in the set, a duplicate has been found. This solution runs in O(n) time because each insertion and lookup in a HashSet is O(1) on average. The space complexity is O(n) due to storing elements in the set.",
